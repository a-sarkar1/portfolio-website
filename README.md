# portfolio-website

I wanted to combine my love for film photography with my passion for data analysis, and this website is the culmination of those two ideas!

This will be a continous personal project I work on as I take more and more photos. My main goal is to document this city over a long period of time and build up a portfolio strong enough to properly represent the neighborhoods I have visited here in the city. 

I hope you enjoy!
